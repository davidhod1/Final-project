# Reinforcement learning with Unity
Purpose of this bachelorâ€™s thesis is to show possibilities of machine learning and deep learning in combination with powerful tools which are used in making virtual simulations.  This is enabled through Unity game engine, a software which is used for developing 2D and 3D video games and simulations, and ML-agents plugin which contains algorithms for training intelligent agents. Basic principles and algorithms of deep learning are described. Agent uses those methods for perception of environment and solving certain tasks. Within thesis, simulation is created in which agent is trying to find hidden item by using reinforcement machine learning. If agent finds item, new place for item is randomly generated. Also, he must complete task in certain time.  With the right implementation and parameters, agent solved the task successfully.
